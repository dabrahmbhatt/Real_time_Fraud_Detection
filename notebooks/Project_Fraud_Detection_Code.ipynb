        "# \n",
        "# Based on this exploratory analysis, we've identified several key patterns that will be valuable for our fraud detection model:\n",
        "# \n",
        "# 1.  **Imbalanced Data:** The dataset is highly imbalanced, which justifies the use of an anomaly detection algorithm like Isolation Forest rather than a standard classification model.\n",
        "# 2.  **High Transaction Amounts:** Fraudulent transactions are strongly correlated with unusually high transaction amounts.\n",
        "# 3.  **International Transactions:** Transactions that are international are significantly more likely to be fraudulent.\n",
        "# 4.  **High-Risk Categories:** The `luxury`, `electronics`, and `travel` merchant categories are hotspots for fraudulent activity.\n",
        "# \n",
        "# These insights confirm that the features `amount` and `is_international` are excellent choices for our initial model. For a more advanced model, we could also incorporate `merchant_category` by encoding it into a numerical format.\n"
